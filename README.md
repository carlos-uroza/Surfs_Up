# Module 9 Challenge - Surf's Up with SQLite and SQLAlchemy

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a program that is capable of quering and investigating the provided weather data for Oahu. The data was provided in an SQLite format. Our client, W. Avy, would like to present summary statistics of temperature data for the month of June and December on Oahu in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round.

## Results

### Deliverable 1 - Temperature Analysis for June

1. Our analysis has found the average temperature for June is 74.94 (F) with a standard deviation of 3.26 (F).
2. The maximum recorded temperature was 85 (F) and the minimum recorded temperature was 64 (F).
3. The median recorded temperature was 75 (F) out of 1700 total observations.

### Deliverable 2 - Temperature Analysis for December

1. Our analysis has found the average temperature for December is 71.04 (F) with a standard deviation of 3.76 (F).
2. The maximum recorded temperature was 56 (F) and the minimum recorded temperature was 83 (F).
3. The median recorded temperature was 71 (F) out of 1517 total observations.

## Summary

In summary, our program provides a high-level seasonality study of temperature data. The findings suggests that the island of Oahu seems to maintain a similar temperature year-round and would be an appropriate location for a surf and ice cream shop.

### Suggestion #1
Another query that could benefit the 
query same june & dec temp data but only for local station (give number)

### Suggestion #2
query same june & dec, but for precipitation data of local station
